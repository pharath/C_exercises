// clock() vs time():
// "The clock function determines the processor time used." C11dr ยง7.26.2.1 2.
// "The time function determines the current calendar time. The encoding of the value is unspecified" C11dr ยง7.26.2.4 2.

// https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPU_time
//
// CPU time:
// - "amount of time for which a central processing unit (CPU) was used for processing 
// instructions of a computer program or operating system"
// - "used to quantify the overall empirical efficiency of two functionally identical algorithms" (e.g. merge sort vs bubble sort)
//
// wall time, elapsed real time:
// - "elapsed time, which includes for example, waiting for input/output (I/O) operations"
// - "Elapsed real time includes I/O time, any multitasking delays, and all other types of waits incurred by the program"
// - "depending on 
//   - real world variables such as the CPU's temperature, as well as 
//   - other operating system variables, such as the process's priority."
